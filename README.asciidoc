walkmod-git-plugin
==================
Raquel Pau <raquelpau@gmail.com>

This is a walkmod plugin to execute walkmod incrementally - only for the unstashed files or for the last commit (when there are not unstashed files).
The repository needs to be a git repository. The filtering level is per file, not per node region.

== Usage (Only Walkmod >= 2.2.0)

Just type:

----
walkmod set-reader git:reader
----
and then, to see the results after:

----
walkmod apply
----

== Contributing

If you want to hack on this, fork it, improve it and send me a pull request.

To get started using it, just clone it and call mvn install.
